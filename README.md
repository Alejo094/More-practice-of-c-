# More-practice-of-c++
In the programs design the idea is to practice matrixs, functions, indexing etc. I made a magic box that depending on the size desire the program automatically scale a special box with numbers and an ATM that needs a user and a password and lets the user take money from his savings account, checking account and make an overdraft from his credit card if needed.

The tricky game has 3 different levels and depending on each the machine will try to win each time harder.
