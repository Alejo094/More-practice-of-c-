# More-practice-of-c++
A couple of c++ programs to practice more cycles , matrix, functions and logic of this language. In the programs design the idea is to practice matrixs, functions, indexing etc. I made a magic box that depending on the size desire the program automatically scale a special box with numbers and an ATM that needs a user and a password and lets the user take money from his savings account, checking account and make an overdraft from his credit card if needed.
